It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is highly soluble in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> neurotoxicity. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> by splitting <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-1176\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/urea\">urea</a> and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamine\">glutamine</a>. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamine\">glutamine</a> synthetase activity, making it a major <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamine\">glutamine</a>-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in patients with liver disease. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> concentrations. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested.

To date RhCG localization has been described as exclusively apical plasma membrane in mouse and rat kidney, or apical and basolateral in humans, and some mouse and rat tissue studies. ... Novel antibodies to RhBG and RhCG /were raised/ to examine their localization in the human kidney. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKI) cell lines stably expressing human green fluorescent protein-tagged RhBG or RhCG and human tissue lysates were used to demonstrate the specificity of these antibodies for detecting RhBG and RhCG. Using immunoperoxidase staining and antigen liberation techniques, both apical and basolateral RhCG localization was observed in the majority of the cells of the distal convoluted tubule and IC of the connecting tubule and collecting duct. Confocal microscopic imaging of normal human kidney cryosections showed that RhCG staining was predominantly localized to the apical membrane in these cells with some basolateral and intracellular staining evident.

In recent years, studies from several laboratories have uncovered a number of factors and pathways that appear to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Foremost is oxidative and nitrosative stress (ONS), which is largely initiated by an <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+). Such increase in Ca(2+) activates a number of enzymes that promote the synthesis of reactive <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-977\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/oxygen\">oxygen</a>-<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-947\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrogen\">nitrogen</a> species, including constitutive <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-145068\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20oxide\">nitric oxide</a> synthase, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5884\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH\">NADPH</a> oxidase and phospholipase A2.

Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> neurotoxicity. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> by splitting <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-1176\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/urea\">urea</a> and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamine\">glutamine</a>. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamine\">glutamine</a> synthetase activity, making it a major <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamine\">glutamine</a>-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in patients with liver disease. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> concentrations. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested. (PMID: <a href=\"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17006913\">17006913</a>, <a href=\"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16167195\">16167195</a>, <a href=\"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377862\">15377862</a>, <a href=\"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15369278\">15369278</a>, <a href=\"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12020619\">12020619</a>). <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is also found to be associated with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link multiple-CIDs\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA\">3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA</a> lyase deficiency, 3-methyl-crotonyl-glycinuria, and citrullinemia type I, which are inborn errors of metabolism."

                    "Description": "**PEER REVIEWED**",
                    "StringValue": "The major hazards encountered in the use and handling of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> stem from its toxicologic properties and reactivity. Exposure to this colorless gas (liquid, if compressed or in aqueous solution) may occur from its use as a fertilizer, chemical intermediate, alkalizer, metal treating/extraction agent, and common household cleaner. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is hazardous by all routes (ie, dermal, ingestion, inhalation), with the liquid capable of burning the skin, causing permanent eye damage, or corroding the digestive tract upon contact; and the gas capable of causing severe eye damage, pulmonary edema, and even death from spasm, inflammation, and edema of the larynx. OSHA has established an <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) of 50 ppm as an 8-hr time-weighted average (TWA). The ACGIH recommends an 8-hr TLV-TWA of 25 ppm. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> levels should be controlled through process enclosure and the use of local exhaust and dilution ventilation, as necessary. While its offensive odor may serve as a warning, to assure against <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> exposure, workers should wear chemical protective clothing composed of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-62703\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/butyl%20rubber\">butyl rubber</a>, natural rubber, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-31369\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/neoprene\">neoprene</a>, nitrile rubber, or <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6338\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/polyvinyl%20chloride\">polyvinyl chloride</a> (not <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-727\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Viton\">Viton</a>), gloves, face protection, and, in emergency situations, a self-contained breathing apparatus. Facilities for quick-drenching the body, as well as eye-wash fountains, should be immediately at hand for the worker. Clothing that becomes wet with liquid <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> should be placed in closed containers until it can be discarded. While this substance does not burn or ignite readily (autoignition temp: 1204 deg F), containers of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may explode in the heat of a fire. For small fires involving <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>, extinguish with dry chemical or CO2, and for large fires, use <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> spray, fog, or foam, taking care to prevent fire control or dilution <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> from causing pollution. More hazardous than its fire potential is <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>'s reactivity with halogens, interhalogens, and oxidizers. These reactions may be violent and/or may form explosive products. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> should be stored in a cool, well-ventilated location, away from sources of ignition, and separate from other chemicals, particularly oxidizing gases (<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-24526\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/chlorine\">chlorine</a>, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-24408\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/bromine\">bromine</a>, and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-807\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/iodine\">iodine</a>) and acids. Aqueous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is commonly containerized in steel drums. Anhydrous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is stored and shipped (prohibited in passenger planes) in pressurized containers, fitted with pressure-relief safety devices, and bearing the label, \"Nonflammable Compressed Gas\". For small spills of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>, isolate 80 feet in all directions from the spill, ventilate the area, and allow vapor or gas to disperse. For large spills, evacuate the area for 160 feet in all directions, and dike to contain the spill for later recovery or disposal and to prevent runoff from causing pollution. Stay upwind and wear positive-pressure breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, as necessary."

Emergency personnel should avoid self-exposure to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-977\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/oxygen\">oxygen</a> or other respiratory support. 3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 4. Transport to a health care facility.

If Shipping Paper not available or no answer, refer to appropriate telephone number listed on the inside back cover. * As an immediate precautionary measure, isolate spill or leak area for at least 100 meters (330 feet) in all directions. * Keep unauthorized personnel away. * Stay upwind. * Many gases are heavier than air and will spread along ground and collect in low or confined areas (sewers, basements, tanks). * Keep out of low areas. * Ventilate closed spaces before entering. <b>PROTECTIVE CLOTHING</b> * Wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). * Wear chemical protective clothing that is specifically recommended by the manufacturer. It may provide little or no thermal protection. * Structural firefighters' protective clothing provides limited protection in fire situations ONLY; it is not effective in spill situations where direct contact with the substance is possible. <b>EVACUATION</b> <b>Spill</b> * See Table 1 - Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for highlighted materials. For non-highlighted materials, increase, in the downwind direction, as necessary, the isolation distance shown under \"PUBLIC SAFETY\". <b>Fire</b> * If tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in a fire, ISOLATE for 1600 meters (1 mile) in all directions; also, consider initial evacuation for 1600 meters (1 mile) in all directions. <b>EMERGENCY RESPONSE</b> <b>FIRE</b> <b>Small Fire</b> * Dry chemical or CO2. <b>Large Fire</b> * <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Water\">Water</a> spray, fog or regular foam. * Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk. * Do not get <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> inside containers. * Damaged cylinders should be handled only by specialists. <b>Fire involving Tanks</b> * Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. * Cool containers with flooding quantities of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> until well after fire is out. * Do not direct <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. * Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. * ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. <b>SPILL OR LEAK</b> * Fully encapsulating, vapor protective clothing should be worn for spills and leaks with no fire. * Do not touch or walk through spilled material. * Stop leak if you can do it without risk. * If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. * Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. * Do not direct <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> at spill or source of leak. * Use <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift.

A pig herd experiencing clinical problems of M. hyopneumoniae infections was selected. In total, 1095 finishing pigs of two replicates in eight compartments each were investigated during the entire finishing period (FP). Indoor PM10 and NH3 were measured at regular intervals during the FP with two Grimm spectrometers and two Graywolf Particle Counters (PM10) and an <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-3081363\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Innova\">Innova</a> photoacoustic gas monitor (NH3). Average daily weight gain (ADG) and mortality were calculated and associated with PM10 and NH3 during the FP. Nasal swabs (10 pigs/compartment) were collected one week prior to slaughter to detect DNA of M. hyopneumoniae with nested PCR (nPCR). The prevalence and extent of pneumonia lesions, and prevalence of fissures and pleurisy were examined at slaughter (29 weeks). The results from the nasal swabs and lung lesions were associated with PM10 and NH3 during the FP and the second half of the FP. In the univariable model, increasing PM10 concentrations resulted in a higher odds of pneumonia lesions (second half of the FP: OR=8.72; P=0.015), more severe pneumonia lesions (FP: P=0.04, second half of the FP: P=0.009), a higher odds of pleurisy lesions (FP: OR=20.91; P&lt;0.001 and second half of the FP: OR=40.85; P&lt;0.001) and a higher number of nPCR positive nasal samples (FP: OR=328.00; P=0.01 and second half of the FP: OR=185.49; P=0.02). Increasing NH3 concentrations in the univariable model resulted in a higher odds of pleurisy lesions (FP: OR=21.54; P=0.003) and a higher number of nPCR positive nasal samples (FP: OR=70.39; P=0.049; second half of the FP: OR=8275.05; P=0.01). In the multivariable model, an increasing PM10 concentration resulted in a higher odds of pleurisy lesions (FP: OR=8.85; P=0.049). These findings indicate that the respiratory health of finishing pigs was significantly affected by PM10."

The role of peripheral <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in the neurotoxic effects of METH was further substantiated by the demonstration that the enhancement of peripheral <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> excretion blocked the increases in brain and plasma <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> and attenuated the long-term depletions of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-681\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dopamine\">dopamine</a> and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5202\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/serotonin\">serotonin</a> typically produced by METH. Conversely, the localized perfusion of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in combination with METH, but not <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6011\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/METHalone\">METH alone</a> or <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> alone, into the striatum recapitulated the neuronal damage produced by the systemic administration of METH. Furthermore, this damage produced by the local administration of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> and METH was blocked by the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-3538\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/GYKI-52466\">GYKI 52466</a> [4-(8-methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepin-5-yl)-benzamine hydrochloride], an <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-1221\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/AMPA\">AMPA</a> receptor antagonist. These findings highlight the importance of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> derived from the periphery as a small-molecule mediator of METH neurotoxicity and more broadly emphasize the importance of peripheral organ damage as a possible mechanism that mediates the neuropathology produced by drugs of abuse and other neuroactive molecules.[Halpin LE, Yamamoto BK; J Neurosci 32 (38): 13155-63 (2012)]   Full text: <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=PMC3464918' target=new>PMC3464918</a>"

Chronic treatment with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5212\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sildenafil\">sildenafil</a> restored learning ability.

Hyperammonemia was induced in male rats by daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-25517\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium%20chloride\">ammonium chloride</a> (100 mg/kg body weight) for 8 weeks. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-62853\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sildenafil%20citrate\">Sildenafil citrate</a> was administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg body weight/3 days) for 8 weeks. Treatment with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5212\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sildenafil\">sildenafil</a> resulted in a significant reduction in plasma liver enzymes, lipid profile as well as brain lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 mRNA. Meanwhile, plasma NO as well as <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-24316\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cGMP\">cGMP</a>, antioxidants and endothelial <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-145068\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20oxide\">nitric oxide</a> synthase (eNOS) gene expression were significantly elevated in the brains of hyperammonemic rats. Our results showed that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5212\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sildenafil\">sildenafil</a> exerts a protective effect on the brain by reversing oxidative stress during hyperammonemia and this could be due to (i) cytoprotective, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects (ii) increasing <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-24316\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cGMP\">cGMP</a> and enhancing the proper metabolism of fats which could suppress <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-977\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/oxygen\">oxygen</a> radical generation and thus preventing oxidative damage in the brain. The exact protective mechanism of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5212\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sildenafil\">sildenafil</a> has to be still investigated ... Consequently, therapeutic modulation of the NO/<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-24316\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cGMP\">cGMP</a> pathway might have important clinical applications to improve brain functions in patients with hyperammonemia or clinical hepatic encephalopathy. /Hyperammonemia/"

We previously described that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-445154\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/resveratrol\">resveratrol</a> is able to significantly modulate glial functioning and has a protective effect during <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> challenge in vitro. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms by which <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-445154\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/resveratrol\">resveratrol</a> can protect C6 astroglial cells from glutamatergic alterations induced by <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-445154\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Resveratrol\">Resveratrol</a> was able to prevent all the effects triggered by <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>: (i) decrease in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link multiple-CIDs\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamate\">glutamate</a> uptake activity and expression of the EAAC1 <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link multiple-CIDs\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamate\">glutamate</a> transporter, the main <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link multiple-CIDs\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamate\">glutamate</a> transporter present in C6 cells; (ii) increase of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link multiple-CIDs\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamate\">glutamate</a> release, which was also dependent on the activation of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter NKCC1; (iii) reduction in GS activity and intracellular <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-124886\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/GSH\">GSH</a> content; and (iv) impairment of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity. Interestingly, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-445154\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/resveratrol\">resveratrol</a>, per se, also positively modulated the astroglial functions evaluated.

The petroleum industry utilizes anhydrous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in neutralizing the acid constituents of crude oil and in protecting equipment such as bubble plate towers, heat exchangers, condensers, and storage tanks from corrosion. It is also used as medication. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> in an aqueous environment exists in equilibrium between ionized <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-223\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium%20cation\">ammonium cation</a> and the non-ionized <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>. This equilibrium can be affected by buffers, pH, temperature, and salinity. Thus, in many cases it is not possible to assign the associated toxicity to the ionized or non-ionized form of the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-947\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrogen\">nitrogen</a>. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Studies using low levels of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> show that inhaled <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is temporarily dissolved in the mucus of the upper respiratory tract, and then a high percentage of it is released back into the expired air. Following exposure to 500 ppm <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> for 10-27 min, healthy male subjects eliminated 70-80% of the inspired <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> by this route. Short term exposure: eye or skin contact with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> can cause irritation, burns, frostbite (anhydrous), and permanent damage. Irritates the respiratory tract causing coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Higher exposure can cause pulmonary edema, a medical emergency, that can be delayed for several hours and is life-threatening. Exposure can cause headache, loss of sense of smell, nausea, and vomiting. Inhalation: nose and throat irritation have been reported at 72 ppm after 5 min exposure. Exposures of 500 ppm for 30 min have caused upper respiratory irritation, tearing, increased pulse rate, and blood pressure. Death has been reported after an exposure to 10,000 ppm for an unknown duration. Skin: Solutions of 2% <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> can cause burns and blisters after 15 min of exposure. These burns may be slow to heal. Anhydrous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may cause skin to freeze. Eyes: Levels of 70 ppm (gas) have caused eye irritation. If not flushed with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> immediately, contact with eye may cause partial or complete blindness. Ingestion: <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> will cause pain if swallowed and burning of the throat and stomach. May cause vomiting. One teaspoon of 28% aqua <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may cause death. Long term exposure: repeated exposure can cause chronic eye, nose, and throat irritation. Repeated lung irritation can result in bronchitis with coughing, shortness of breath, and phlegm. Analysis of blood samples from 22 workers exposed to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in a fertilizer factory and 42 control workers not exposed to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> showed increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), increased mitotic index (MI), and increased frequency of CAs and SCEs with increasing length of exposure. ANIMAL STUDIES: Analysis of endogenous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> levels in the expired air of rats showed concentrations ranging from 10-353 ppb (mean = 78 ppb) in nose-breathing animals. The quantitative difference between inspired and expired <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> suggests that small amounts are absorbed across the nasopharyngeal membranes into the systemic circulation. Absorbed <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is excreted by the kidneys as <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-1176\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/urea\">urea</a> and urinary <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-223\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium\">ammonium</a> compounds, as <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-1176\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/urea\">urea</a> in feces, and as components of sweat. Toxic levels do not develop as a result of chronic inhalation exposure because the body has multiple effective mechanisms for detoxifying and excreting it. Cardiovascular changes that may be analogous to those observed in humans have been observed in rabbits exposed to high concentrations of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>. Bradycardia was seen at 2,500 ppm, and hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias leading to cardiovascular collapse followed acute exposures to concentrations exceeding 5,000 ppm. Pathological correlates for these effects have not been demonstrated. Atrophy of pericardial fat has been observed in mice exposed to 4,000 ppm <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>. Hepatic effects are usually not seen in animals exposed to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> gas. Liver necrosis has been observed following acute lethal exposure of mice to 3,440 ppm <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> for 1 hour. Levels of 170 ppm of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> vapor caused mild changes in the spleens, kidneys, and livers of guinea pigs. Static exposures of cats and rabbits for 1 hr at 7000 mg/cu m resulted in the death of approx 50%. Postmortem exam showed severe effects on the upper respiratory tract. Less severe effects in the lower respiratory tract included damage to bronchioles and alveolar congestion, edema, atelectasis, hemorrhage, emphysema, and fluid. The search for the peripheral toxins responsible for the CNS impairment present in hepatic encephalopathy has shown that the administration of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in normal rats reproduced behavioral and electrophysiological changes similar to those seen in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-24154\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/galactosamine\">galactosamine</a> induced encephalopathy. No statistically significant differences were noted in ovarian or uterine weights of pigs exposed to about 7 or 35 ppm <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> for 6 weeks. Female pigs that were continuously exposed to about 35 ppm <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> from 6 weeks before breeding until day 30 of gestation had no statistically significant differences in age at puberty, number of live fetuses, or fetus-to-corpus luteum ratio compared to pigs exposed to only about 7 ppm. No unexposed controls were included in that study. No statistically significant difference in fetal length was evident at 30 days of gestation in offspring of pig dams that were continuously exposed to about 7 or 35 ppm <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> from 6 weeks before breeding until day 30 of gestation. The mutagenicity of anhydrous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> was investigated in a Ames test in S. typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538, and in E. coli WP2uvrA. The test method was modified appropriately to investigate a volatile test substance. Studies were performed in duplicate in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. No evidence of mutagenicity was seen under the conditions of this assay. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> is an environmental pollutant that is toxic to all aquatic animals. The major sources for atmospheric NH3 are agricultural activities and animal feedlot operations, followed by biomass burning (including forest fires) and to a lesser extent fossil fuel combustion. Close to its sources, acute exposures to NH3 can result in visible foliar injury on vegetation."

End points monitored included subjective and objective measures of eye and throat irritation as well as pulse rate, respiration rate, pulmonary function (FVC, FEV), assessment of neurological function (reflex, balance, and coordination), and body weight. The exposure protocol consisted of a pre-exposure evaluation by a physician, 3 hr of exposure (this conflicts with exposure data on table 2 of the study and mentioned above), a mid-point physician's observation, lunch break, 3 additional hr of exposure, and a third physician's observation 30 min after exposure ceased. The conjunctiva and mucosa of the nose and throat were examined by a physician before and after each daily exposure and the degree of irritation noted was described as mild, moderate, or marked. Exposure to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> had no significant effect on the measures of respiratory function or in the neurological tests conducted.

The perceived acute health symptoms and self-reported changes of well-being were assessed by the German version of a questionnaire of the Swedish Performance Evaluation System (SPES). Personal traits were ascertained with the positive and negative affectivity schedule (PANAS) and the Freiburger Personlichkeits Inventar (FPI). There are significant associations between personal traits and the amount of complaints. Subjects with high positive affectivity report less respiratory and irritative complaints, whereas persons with negative affectivity report significantly more olfactory and respiratory symptoms.

Skin: Solutions of 2% <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> can cause burns and blisters after 15 min of exposure. These burns may be slow to heal. Anhydrous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may cause skin to freeze. Eyes: Levels of 70 ppm (gas) have caused eye irritation. If not flushed with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> immediately, contact with eye may cause partial or complete blindness. Ingestion: <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> will cause pain if swallowed and burning of the throat and stomach. May cause vomiting. One teaspoon of 28% aqua <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may cause death. Long term exposure: repeated exposure can cause chronic eye, nose, and throat irritation. Repeated lung irritation can result in bronchitis with coughing, shortness of breath, and phlegm."

Its high <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> solubility allows it to dissolve in moisture on these surfaces, react with fatty substances, be absorbed into deeper layers, and inflict extensive damage.

There is a high rise in number of cases of toxicity due to overdose of VPA. Hyperammonemia, a common side-effect of VPA, is caused by several proposed etiologies, reported as having uncertain correlation with VPA dose or concentration. We present here a case of a 25-year-old female patient with a past history of psychiatric complaints, presented with elevated serum VPA levels associated with elevated venous <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> levels subsequent to VPA overdose.

A questionnaire was administered to obtain information on exposure and work histories and to determine eye, skin and respiratory symptomatology (based on the American Thoracic Society [ATS] questionnaire. Spirometry (FVC [Forced Expiratory Vital Capacity], FEV-1 [Forced Expiratory Volume for 1 sec], FEF50 [Forced Expiratory Flow at 50%] and FEF75 [Forced Expiratory Flow at 75%]) was performed according to ATS criteria at the beginning and end of each work shift on the first workday of the week (day 1) and the last workday of the week (day 2). Differences in reported symptoms and lung function between groups were evaluated using the actual values and with age, height and pack-years smoked as covariates in linear regression analysis. Baseline lung function results were expressed as percent of predicted values ...  for FVC and FEV-1 and ... for FEF50 and FEF75.  No statistical difference in the prevalence of the reporting symptoms was evident between the exposed and control groups, although workers reported that exposure at the plant had aggravated specific symptoms including coughing, wheezing, nasal complaints, eye irritation, throat discomfort and skin problems. The percentage of exposed workers reporting hay fever or familial history of hay fever was significantly less than controls, suggesting possible self-selection of atopic individuals out of this work force. The atopic status of the worker and control groups was not determined by skin prick tests to common aeroallergens. Furthermore, the workers complained that their symptomatology was exacerbated even though there was no statistical difference between groups. Since the study was cross-sectional in design with a small population, it is possible that selection bias may have occurred. Baseline lung functions (based on the best spirometry values obtained during the four testing sessions) were similar in the exposed and control groups. No changes in lung function were demonstrated over either work shift (days 1 or 2) or over the work week in the exposed group compared with controls. No relationship was demonstrated between chronic <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> exposure and baseline lung function changes either in terms of the level or duration of exposure, probably due to lack of adequate exposure data for categorizing exposures and thus precluding development of a meaningful index accounting for both level and length of exposure.  Based on the lack of subjective symptomatology and changes in spirometry, this study establishes a free-standing TWA NOAEL of 9.2 ppm (6.4 mg/cu m).

Astrocytes are considered the primary target of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> toxicity in the central nervous system (CNS) because <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutamine\">glutamine</a> synthetase (GS), responsible for <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> metabolism in CNS, is an astrocytic enzyme. Thus, neuronal dysfunction has been associated as secondary to astrocytic impairment. However, we demonstrated that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> can induce direct effects on neuronal cells.

Thus, this study reinforces the neuroprotective effects of RSV and LA. Although more studies in vivo are required, RSV and LA could represent interesting therapeutic strategies for the management of HE."

Experiment 1 examined trade-offs between time and concentration at threshold level by means of nasal lateralization, a common measure of irritation threshold. Within experimental sessions, the duration of a fixed-concentration stimulus varied to determine the shortest, detectable pulse. Subjects could lateralize increasingly weaker concentrations with longer stimulus presentations. Experiment 2 examined an analogous trade-off for supra-threshold irritation. Subjects rated irritation from presentations of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> that varied both in concentration and in duration.

The mechanisms leading to these severe brain lesions are still not well understood, but recent studies show that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-223\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium\">ammonium</a> exposure alters several amino acid pathways and neurotransmitter systems, cerebral energy metabolism, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-145068\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20oxide\">nitric oxide</a> synthesis, oxidative stress and signal transduction pathways.

At sublethal exposure levels the ventilation of rats was about one third of normal breathing. This change in ventilation and inhalation dosimetry was adjusted for Cxt-dependent lethal endpoints whereas sensory irritation-related phenomena were C-dependently adjusted. In summary, the outcome of this study shows that C- and C x t-dependent causes of toxicity need to be appreciated when extrapolating across species with species-specific inhalation dosimetry. It also appears to be indispensable that each exposure metric must be disentangled when translating C x t-dependent lethality and reflexively-induced, sensation-based C-dependent point of departures.

The mean concentrations of environmental contaminants were calculated for the most productive farrowing operations and the least productive ones and compared with lower production variables. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> concentration was related to number of pigs weaned per litter, and total and respirable dust concentrations were related to prolonged age to reach a weight of 25 kg. Another comparison involved the stratification of the finishing farms into quartiles according to percentage of pigs with specified disease conditions and comparison of mean concentrations of various environmental contaminants for each farm in each strata. Levels of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> (in the animal breathing zone) greater than 25, 29, and 23 ppm were associated with buildings in which pneumonia, pleuritis, and arthritis, respectively, were greater than the mean value for the group. Overall, respirable dust (&gt; 0.8 mg/cu m), <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> (&gt; 23 ppm in the animal breathing zone), and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-280\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/carbon%20dioxide\">carbon dioxide</a> (&gt; 2,000 ppm) levels were most often associated with increased disease. Possible study shortcomings noted ... were that pre-existing conditions could have been present in the pigs (before they entered the finishing barns) and that nasal turbinates were not routinely examined for abnormalities. These data suggest that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may contribute to respiratory and other pathological conditions in pigs raised in crowded, enclosed conditions, but the exact contribution of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is difficult to assess."

Since defective synthesis and release of astrocytic factors have been shown to impair synaptic integrity in other neurological conditions, we examined whether thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an astrocytic factor involved in the maintenance of synaptic integrity, is also altered in CHE. Cultured astrocytes were exposed to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> (NH4Cl, 0.5-2.5 mM) for 1-10 days, and TSP-1 content was measured in cell extracts and culture media. Astrocytes exposed to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> exhibited a reduction in intra- and extracellular TSP-1 levels. Exposure of cultured neurons to conditioned media from <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-treated astrocytes showed a decrease in synaptophysin, PSD95, and synaptotagmin levels. Conditioned media from TSP-1 over-expressing astrocytes that were treated with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>, when added to cultured neurons, reversed the decline in synaptic proteins.

Likewise, we found a significant decline in TSP-1 level in cortical astrocytes, as well as a reduction in synaptophysin content in vivo in a rat model of CHE. These findings suggest that TSP-1 may represent an important therapeutic target for CHE. Defective release of astrocytic factors may impair synaptic integrity in chronic hepatic encephalopathy.

Exposure of neurons to CM from <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-treated astrocytes, in which TSP-1 is over-expressed, reversed (by approx 75%) the reduction in synaptic proteins.

In addition to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>, recent studies suggest that inflammation and associated cytokines (CKs) also contribute to the pathogenesis of HE. It was previously established that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> induces the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) in cultured astrocytes. As CKs have been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in other conditions, we examined whether CKs induce the mPT in cultured astrocytes.

Simultaneous treatment of cultures with a mixture of CKs and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> showed a marked additive effect on the mPT.

Samples from the second batch were analyzed for global gene expression using 23 K Affymetrix GeneChip porcine genome arrays. Samples from both batches were subsequently tested for five candidate genes using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).

Up-regulated proteins are related to oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis. Down-regulated proteins are related to cell structure and growth, transcriptional and translational regulation, immune response, oxidative stress and nutrient metabolism. These results indicated that exposure to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> triggered oxidative stress, and interfered with nutrient absorption and immune function in the small intestinal mucosa of broilers. These findings have important implications for understanding the toxic mechanisms of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> on intestine of broilers, which provides new information that can be used for intervention using nutritional strategies in the future.[Zhang J et al; Proteome Sci 13:9 (2015)]   Full text: <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=PMC4347970' target=new>PMC4347970</a>"

To date, most studies of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> toxicity have focused on the nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract in mammals. However, few detailed studies have been conducted on the hepatic response to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> toxicity in poultry. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these effects remain unclear. In the present study, our group applied isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis to investigate changes in the protein profile change in hepatic tissue of broilers exposed to high concentrations of atmospheric <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>, with the goal of characterizing the molecular mechanisms of chronic liver injury from exposure to high ambient levels of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>. Overall, 30 differentially expressed proteins that are involved in nutrient metabolism (energy, lipid, and amino acid), immune response, transcriptional and translational regulation, stress response, and detoxification were identified. In particular, two of these proteins, beta-1 galactosidase (GLB1) and a kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 8-like (AKAP8 L), were previously suggested to be potential biomarkers of chronic liver injury. In addition to the changes in the protein profile, serum parameters and histochemical analyses of hepatic tissue also showed extensive hepatic damage in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-exposed broilers. Altogether, these findings suggest that longtime exposure to high concentrations of atmospheric <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> can trigger chronic hepatic injury in broilers via different mechanisms, providing new information that can be used for intervention using nutritional strategies in the future.[Zhang J et al; PLoS One 10 (4): e0123596 (2015)]   Full text: <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=PMC4406733' target=new>PMC4406733</a>"

Progression of acute liver failure (ALF) leads to multi-organ failure, systemic inflammatory response, hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, which seem the most important immediate causes of mortality in patients with ALF.

Large amounts of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> are released to the atmosphere worldwide by domesticated farm animals. Natural sources of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> emissions to the atmosphere are volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and the decomposition of nitrogenous compounds arising from microbially-fixed <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-947\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrogen\">nitrogen</a>. If released to the atmosphere, a vapor pressure of 7500 mm Hg at 25 deg C indicates <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-961\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydroxyl\">hydroxyl</a> radicals and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-943\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrate\">nitrate</a> radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 100 and 54 days respectively. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> reacts rapidly in the atmosphere with both sulfuric and nitric acids to form fine particles. The formation of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-223\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium\">ammonium</a> ions in air can result in incorporation into an aerosol or as part of the ionic mix found in cloud and raindrops. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> itself can dissolve in the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> in the atmosphere and form clouds or fog. The half-life for <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in the atmosphere has been estimated to be a few days. The reaction with acidic substances in the air results in the formation of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-223\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium\">ammonium</a> aerosols that can be removed by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may either volatilize to the atmosphere, adsorb to particulate matter, or undergo microbial transformation to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-943\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrate\">nitrate</a> or <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-946\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrite\">nitrite</a> anions. Uptake by plants can also be an important fate process. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonia\">Ammonia</a> at natural concentrations in soil is not believed to have a very long half-life. If <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is distributed to soil in large concentrations (such as following an <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-containing fertilizer application), the natural biological transformation processes can be overwhelmed, and the environmental fate of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> will become dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>, until the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> concentration returns to background levels. If released to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a>, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may adsorb to sediments or suspended organic material. Transformation of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> occurs primarily by the microbial processes of nitrification (yielding <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-943\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrate\">nitrate</a> and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-946\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitrite\">nitrite</a> anions) and denitrification. Volatilization from <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a> surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 1.61X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. In <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a>, <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is in equilibrium with the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-223\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium%20ion\">ammonium ion</a> (NH4+), and the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-223\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonium%20ion\">ammonium ion</a> equilibrium is dependent on the pH. Occupational exposure to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> is produced or used. Farmers may be exposed during the application of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-containing fertilizers, or manures high in <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> content. The general population may be exposed to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a>, and dermal contact with consumer products containing <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>. Low levels of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a> can occur naturally in food and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-962\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water\">water</a>. Exposure to the general population can especially occur during use of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-222\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia\">ammonia</a>-containing household cleaners.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.
